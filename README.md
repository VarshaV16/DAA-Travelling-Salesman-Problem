# DAA-Travelling-Salesman-Problem



## Aim :
To implement Travelling Salesman Problem for a directed graph.

##Objective: Generate a path from source vertex covering all the vertices of the graph and reaching back to source distance in 
              Case 1: Minimum distance
              Case 2: Minimum time
              Case 3: Average Distance and Average time


**We have used a 3D array for storing the values of distance and time**

###### step 1 : Creating a 3D Matrix
###### step 2 : In function , Creating a vertex vector for inermediate nodes
###### step 3 : Calculating the pathweight/time by taking different combinations of vertices
###### step 4 : Storing the nodes of minimum path values in a route array
###### step 5 : Comparing previous minimum with current pathweight to select the new minimum
###### step 6 : Printing the route for minimum pathweight/time
###### step 7 : Returning minimum pathweight/time value
